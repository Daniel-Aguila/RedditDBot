# RedditDBots
This Reddit Bot scans a certain subreddit and allows you to return whatever message one has put on it
as a reply.

## Main Library used
* imort praw

We used 'praw' to scrape Reddit subreddits. While working on this project, I got familiar with the linux/Unix terminal.

## What I learned from this

* I got introduced to web scraping and how to incorporate an API (Reddit's) into my python program.
* I got familiar with git on the terminal, instead of only using "push/pull" from my IDE.
* How to store information(users id) on a txt, and check the txt to make sure the bot does respond multiple times
  unless you want it.

## Languages Used

* Python

## Currently working on

Getting the bot to automate via a VM (vagrant) through the linux terminal.

## Achievements

Program runs manually, will soon start the process to try to make it Automated

## Problem with Automate

In the VM praw.ini has not being linked, and when the program starts, it crashes
